function fprintf
<cstdio>(stdio.h)
23.04.2009
C,C++
Writes the C string pointed by format to the stream. If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
After the format parameter, the function expects at least as many additional arguments as specified by format.
###
function gets
<cstdio>(stdio.h)
25.09.2010
C
Reads characters from the standard input (stdin) and stores them as a C string into str until a newline character or the end-of-file is reached.
The newline character, if found, is not copied into str.
A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters copied to str.
Notice that gets is quite different from fgets: not only gets uses stdin as source, but it does not include the ending newline character in the resulting string and does not allow to specify a maximum size for str (which can lead to buffer overflows).

function cosh
<cmath>(math.h)

C,C++
Returns the hyperbolic cosine of x.
